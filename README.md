Signal Quality Prediction & Digit Classification
Project Overview

This project focuses on two areas: Signal Quality Prediction (Electronics & Telecommunication) and Digit Classification (Autonomous Vehicles).
Part A: Signal Quality Prediction

    Objective: Build a classifier to predict signal strength based on various parameters.
    Steps:
        Data Understanding: Import data, check for missing values, duplicates, and visualize target distribution.
        Preprocessing: Split data into train/test sets, normalize, and transform labels for neural network input.
        Modeling: Design, train, and evaluate a neural network. Modify architecture to improve performance and visualize training results.

Part B: Digit Classification (SVHN Dataset)

    Objective: Classify digits from street-view images.
    Steps:
        Data Exploration: Load and split the dataset.
        Preprocessing: Reshape, normalize images, and transform labels.
        Modeling: Design, train, and evaluate a neural network. Analyze model performance using accuracy and loss plots.

Tools:

    Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib.
    Methods: Neural networks, data normalization, image preprocessing.
